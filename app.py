  - Provide examples and professional scenarios where these traits would be advantageous.
  - Link to the relevant Truity page for each trait like so: https://www.truity.com/blog/page/<lowercase_trait>-dimension-personality (if you list each trait, link at the initial listing of the trait, eg [Openness](https://www.truity.com/blog/page/openness-dimension-personality): ______).
  - Also link to the Big Five assessment doing something like (doesn't have to be exact): You can take our (Big Five)[https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test] personality test to see how these traits play out in your life.

#### TypeFinder types of {PROFESSION}s:

  - Also link to the TypeFinder assessment doing something like (doesn't have to be exact): Take our (TypeFinder)[https://www.truity.com/test/type-finder-personality-test-new] assessment to find out your unique type!

FINAL CRITICAL NOTES:

1. PLEASE FORMAT THE BLOG IN MARKDOWN!

2. THE ENTIRE BLOG SHOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 1500 WORDS. THIS IS A CRITICAL REQUIREMENT.
AVOID MAKING THE BLOG TOO SHORT! IT MUST BE 1500 WORDS! YOU WILL NOT RUN OUT OF TOKENS AT THIS LENGTH!

3. For Big 5, if a personality trait is orthogonal or unrelated to the profession, just say so! Don't grasp for straws if there are none.

3. Do not end any section header with a colon (":"). They should be natural sounding headers appropriate to that section.
